/*
  Basic UTF-8 manipulation routines
  by Jeff Bezanson
  placed in the public domain Fall 2005

  This code is designed to provide the utilities you need to manipulate
  UTF-8 as an internal string encoding. These functions do not perform the
  error checking normally needed when handling UTF-8 data, so if you happen
  to be from the Unicode Consortium you will want to flay me alive.
  I do this because error checking can be performed at the boundaries (I/O),
  with these routines reserved for higher performance on data known to be
  valid.
